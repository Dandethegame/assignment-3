<p>Duong Minh Duc Anh – s3618640</p>
This is a remarkable period when working and studying with Khoa and Long, and it helped me to enhance my studies. In this training, I learnt many excellent things together with them, including how effectively to work in a team, how to arrange work on a timetable and how to work intelligently.
Long, on the other hand, is a guy who always works on time and on schedule. He is a calm individual who cares about his teammates and the team's work throughout the process of working together. Whenever he attends a group meeting, he always shares his own thoughts and points of view while also listening to the perspectives of others. I acquired time management and C++ programming abilities from him, and while I'm not particularly good, I understand the fundamentals. Our collaborative project was a success thanks to him. Hopefully, we will be able to collaborate again in the future.
Talking about Khoa, is an extrovert who constantly interacts pleasantly and speaks a lot at every meeting. He had a lot of ideas, some of which were bad, but the more the merrier. He is not as cautious as Long, but he is a cheerful guy who is always willing to assist those who are having difficulties with their job. Khoa's strength is English; he is always conducting research for the group, reading articles or tutorials from foreign sources, and explaining them in an easy-to-understand manner. Most significantly, he always completes tasks ahead of schedule. It was a joy to collaborate with him. I hope we can collaborate in the future.

Working with this team has been a pleasant experience for me. My teammates have been helpful, and our shared passion has been a good motivation so far. Overall, my time working with them is pleasant. Both Anh and Khoa are hardworking, and our team meeting was productive thanks to their effort. 
Duc Anh has been a significant help in organizing team meetings and with the work on the report. He also allowed us to base the project on our ideas which simplify the process a lot. His organization skills are critical for the running of the team.
Dang Khoa has been assisting me and my team throughout the project. He has contributed to the workload and has initiated a lot of discussion to help make the project run smoothly. He helps mediate the team and his opinion is valuable.

When I initially started in this group, I had absolutely no expectation, and to be honest, the efforts that both Long and Anh put into their work are mind blowing. The fact that we were all on the same page from the beginning, and that Long and I have the almost exact same idea, is a miracle. 
Where do I even start with Long. If I were to describe Long in two words, it would be persevering and consistent. Every task we give Long, he always finishes it within time and the quality of each task is all the same. This is exactly the type of person that I want to work with. Someone who is hard working and always completes their task with the same consistency. Additionally, he has also been a significant help when it comes to conceptualizing our idea. Due to the similarities between both of our 2nd projects, it was an easy and quick process of deciding on what to do as a team. 
Anh and I go way back, we used to have classes together, and we still are best online friends. He and I have been playing games with each other for years now, so it makes sense that he is the one that understands me the most out of all. The fact that we were on the same page about making a game is no surprise. As a result, something clicked as soon as we started working. There were tasks that we shared, and the workflow was smooth and fast. You can say that I am glad to have Anh as one of my groupmates.
