Topic <br>
Our team members share a common theme of creating a video game through a specific game engine. For that, we have all gathered our collective thought and decided that it would be best for us to create a video game through Unreal Engine 4/5. To be more specific, we are creating a strategic retro turn-based Role-Playing Game. The main reason is that two of our members have the same project idea, from the concept down to the execution. Hence, it would be best for the group to work on something in which two members are already on the same thought process.<br><br>
Onto the specification, the gameplay of our project would be like another popular franchise of the same genre, Fire Emblem. If you do not already know how Fire Emblem works, check Appendix A. However, the main attraction of our game is that it plays like Fire Emblem, but every unit comes with its battalion. Instead of a duel between two units, it would be a full-on battle with two battalions and their generals. Whoever wins relies entirely on the general's stats, the influence the general has on the battalion, and the player's strategic decisions. <br><br>
Motivation<br><br>
As previously mentioned, we collectively chose games as our main idea is because we all share a passion for gaming in general. For our generation, games were and still are an essential part of our lives. Because of it, we have created one of the best memories shared with friends and families. Even though we have different experiences when it comes to gaming, but it led us to the discovery of coding, and eventually game design. Additionally, the gaming industry is a booming business area, with hundreds and thousands of games and game-supported products being made and created.<br><br> 
Landscape<br><br>
We already mentioned in our topic that our game will be based on Fire Emblem as the foundation to implement our idea into it. There are tons of games out there that play just like Fire Emblem, but so far, we have not seen any games that have the same concept as ours. Because our game is based on Fire Emblem, it can also be considered as our competitor. However, instead of competing with other franchises and games within the same genre. We hope that we can deliver to the strategic turn-based RPG fans out there a different twist and experience on the genre itself.<br><br>
