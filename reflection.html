<p>Duong Minh Duc Anh – s3618640</p>
In the process of working together as a team, the result is not the best we achieve or the knowledge but the similarity in communication and teamwork. However, the most challenging aspect is the ability to find out or research information. We always have a difficult time finding resources to support our writings or information to support our viewpoints. It took a long time to locate a decent piece of information since the group's reading comprehension was weak. Hopefully, following this project essay, we will be aware of our weaknesses and will be able to improve them in the future. Long shocked me when I found that he knew a lot about coding while we worked together, especially he made a small game and taught me much about it, and Khoa told me the greatest parts about it. The beauty of the kind of game we're doing with this project. Finally, the nice thing I've learnt from this group is that while together we'll learn more and more new and intriguing things, although ideas are different.
<p>Do Ha Minh Long – s3634734</p>
My time working with this assignment has been mostly pleasant. Because the assignment is mostly about brainstorming and researching about our potential career path, the work we must do is not technically challenging which allows me to easily talk with my team. As this is not my first team project, there was little new experience and issue, and the casual pace of the assignment minimized any problem with the team interaction. I wish I could have pushed the team to work more efficiently but it is hard to do so when I myself was not fully focused on the assignment myself. Working with this small group let me see the mobility of this group size but also the limitation on the lack of flexibility due to lack of specialization. In the end, I have a productive and educational time with the project.
<p>Nguyen Tuong Dang Khoa – s3891524</p>
Personally, I did what I could for the team. I feel like my job is a translator, but instead of translating languages, I translated ideas and thoughts. Considering how close I am to Anh, and how Long and I have similar ideas, I was given the job of a middleman, where I would help Long, and Anh convey their ideas and thoughts to each other. Because of that, Anh had no problem transitioning to a new project idea that’s completely different from his. My one regret is that we are not making a real product. This whole thing has felt so real for me, almost like we are an actual team of developers in the process of making a game. I have a burning passion for gaming, so seeing how well we work together as a team really sparks my motivation and interest. If only we have time to create the actual game, I feel like we could succeed. I already previously mentioned this, but the only thing that surprises me is how fast both Anh and Long work. It is like they finish the same tasks as soon as they are given. I always have problems with productivity and lack of motivation but seeing how they work really pushes me to become better and not be a hindrance to my teammates. 
<p>Group Statement</p>
Overall, the work process with the team was smooth and there was minimal conflict between the groups. The three of us managed to present our ideas freely and the low stake made deciding on the path forward simple and painless. The moment we decided on what to do, the project proceeded smoothly. However, the process does lack a sense of urgency and the project could have been made more time efficient and our goal could have been finished earlier. The biggest issue is the late arrival of a team member requiring us to replan the work distribution and causing some cascading delay of the project. Even when one person arriving late, Khoa generally performed a good job at the work he was appointed, albeit a little late with the timetable, the assignment for each member was not seamless. As for Long, he did a wonderful job learning about the project. The team's gaming project followed the essay with the aid of Khoa. As regards Duc Anh, the task was given to everybody, and everyone divided the job properly. With it he wrote and structured and rectified the project types, and made it seem professional. The report was presented. Everyone has done a good job, but generally, it was still the team's weakness to accomplish tasks on time. Hope we can be improved in the future to work ahead of time. . But it is still impossible not to mention that all members are very good at programming languages.  It is a surprise to everyone in general and in particular to the student community because not everybody in this group specializes in programming. And the lesson that we learned in this group work is that anyone can do the job just by trying and learning hard, and more importantly, learning the experience of working on time.
