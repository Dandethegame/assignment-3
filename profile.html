<p style="color:rgb(49, 58, 190);">Team Name</p>

We spoke about it and eventually decided on a new group name, rather than each person's current group name. We arrive at the name KLA, with each letter representing the initial letter of each member's name. We believe this is the greatest and most equitable name for everyone. If written out completely, it also means Key Learning Alliance.

Duong Minh Duc Anh (s361864) - Email: s3618640@rmit.edu.vn<br><br>
I studied and worked in Australia for seven years. I wanted to go back to Vietnam because of Covid. Personally, I know how to code in HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript. I am a huge fan of video games, particularly role-playing games. It brought me to programming, my dream in the future is to be able to make a role-playing game that simulates our real life. And that is also my hobby, studying and contributing to numerous RPG projects. <br><br>
           Do Ha Minh Long (s3634734) - Email:  s3634734@rmit.edu.vn<br><br>
I am a first year IT student although I have a degree in economics. I have studied the basics of Java, HTML/CSS/JavaScript and have dabbled in game programming using Unity and C#. My passion is in history, especially military history and my dream is to create many video games of this topic.<br><br> 
Nguyen Tuong Dang Khoa (s3891524) - Email: s3891524@rmit.edu.vn<br><br>
I used to study abroad in American for 5 years, but because Covid I had to move back to Vietnam. However, that does not matter now as I am now one of the students in Rmit. I have a burning passion for game design and want to learn everything I can to create a game that fits my vision and creative ideas.<br><br>
Hua Van Anh Khoa(s3883254) - Email: s3883254@rmit.edu.vn<br><br>
I am an information technology student. I know the languages html, CSS, JavaScript, framework bootstrap, structured query language: MySQL during my time studying in high school in Canada. Also, I can code in c, python, and java. I am extremely interested in studying algorithms as well as the field of machine learning. I participated in an amazon reinforcement learning competition and was curious about AI algorithms in game programming.<br><br>

The only speed bump that ever occurred was how late we started doing the assignment. We were all so caught up with our other classes that we almost forgot about this assignment. Besides that, the transition between assignment 2 to assignment 3 was not a big problem due to all of us having the same goal of making a game, especially Long and I whose ideas are similar. If this assignment was extended, I think we might be able to make a complete and functional demo that can be played with. 
<br>
<p style="color:rgb(49, 58, 190);">Career Plans</p>

Of the four members of the group, three are directly interested in game design as a profession. Anh, Long and Dang Khoa is focus on career game design where direct programming skills are used as secondary skills to the more important content design and user engagement design. However, depending on their career path, these three have the option of specializing in as a game designer or they could multi-task into being game programmers who will be responsible for translating the designer vision into systems in a game.
<br><br>
Anh Khoa who is focused on machine learning is focused on a career path focusing more on tool development and programming rather than any direct interaction with the game itself. With his intended career, He will help build the tools that help make game developer life easier such as machine learning based software and function that simplify the workflow of the team such as AI based renderer or even AI that can replace or supplement the job of artists.
