<p>Art Designer:</p>
It is without a doubt that we need an art designer for the complete product. A game is not a game when it does not have its charming and amazing graphics. Our game is a “retro” game which some consider that the graphic is outdated. However, they are quite niche, some would even argue that the pixelated graphics were the charm of it. As a result, we would like to keep it completely retro with pixelated styles. This would require us to have a pixel artist who can portray our ideas as accurately as possible.
<p>Sound Engineer/Composer:</p>
One of the two major creative positions that require specialized skill that a programmer will unlikely able to fulfill. The composer is responsible for the music that will help make the game experience complete. For the specification of our project, we would require a composer who is knowledgeable in chiptune-style sound and music which is the music style design the limited music of old game console which was design around the lack of sophisticated sound chip and speaker to play realistic sound. As our team is small the composer will also take the role or help with the sound engineer who will be responsible for creating the sound effect and programming sound into the game. 
<p>A Writer:</p>
The charm of an RPG game is its story. It sometimes can be quite cliché, but excellent story writing is what keep people thinking. A lot of times, a good game compels the player to try it out, and they might have a wonderful experience. However, a great story is what keeps a lot of players back and motivates them to finish the game to unravel the story. Personally, I do not think any of us can draft a perfect story with decent dialogues. This could end up making the characters in the game feel silly, and sometimes drag the players out of the emersion. Therefore, we want to have a writer that knows their craft, to better portray the story we are trying to tell.
<p>PR Manager:</p>
To release and support a commercial game, a person whose responsibility is to manage the social media presence and help handle customer support is needed. The PR manager is a role theoretically by a member of the development team but creating a separate position allows the dev team to focus on their specialization and minimize the risk of a developer causing controversy.
